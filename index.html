    <h3>About Evil Morty</h3>
    
    <p id="tribute-info">President Mortimer "Morty" Smith, nicknamed Evil Morty by fans, is a major antagonist in the adult animated TV series Rick and Morty, serving as the main antagonist of the episodes "Close Rick-counters of the Rick Kind" and "The Rick-lantis Mix-Up".

      <br>
      
Yet another alternative universe version of Morty Smith, Evil Morty was the creator of Evil Rick Sanchez and the one truly responsible for the deaths of Ricks and abductions of Mortys from different universes; he managed to escape capture and be elected first President of the Citadel of Ricks following the destruction of the public Council of Ricks.</p>

    <h3>Appearance</h3>
<p>Evil Morty has the same appearance as most other Mortys with a yellow shirt, dark blue pants, black shoes and short brown hair but sporting an eyepatch and with black socks. He removed it after Evil Rick was killed and later wore a regular dark gray colored suit and belt with a red tie; when removing his eyepatch this exposed wiring poking out from under his eye which he promptly pushed back in.</p>
